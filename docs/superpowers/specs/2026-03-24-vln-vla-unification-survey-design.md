# VLN-VLA Unification Survey — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-03-24
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Qing Li + Claude Code

## Goal

Build a literature survey in the Obsidian vault exploring the convergence of VLN (Vision-and-Language Navigation) and VLA (Vision-Language-Action) foundation models for indoor home robotics, with SLAM as a spatial memory bridge. The survey aims to identify research gaps and ultimately produce a concrete research idea.

## Perspective

**Foundation model viewpoint:** Both VLN and VLA are converging toward VLM backbone + action prediction architectures. The core question is whether and how they can be unified, and what role SLAM-based spatial representations play in enabling that unification.

## Deliverables

All output lives inside the Obsidian vault:

1. **Core Topic Note:** `Topics/VLN-VLA-Unification.md`
2. **New Paper Notes:** 10-15 papers in `Papers/`, following `AuthorYear-ShortTitle.md` naming
3. **Idea Note:** `Ideas/` (when survey matures), following `Templates/Idea.md` template (status: `raw`, with Core Idea, Motivation, Related Work, Rough Plan, Open Questions)

## Topic Note Structure

`Topics/VLN-VLA-Unification.md` is organized into 6 sections. This extends beyond the standard `Templates/Topic.md` structure (which has Overview, Paper Comparison table, Key Takeaways, Open Problems) because a deep cross-domain survey requires richer organization. The template's Paper Comparison table concept is incorporated into Section 4.

**Topic note frontmatter:**

### Section 1: VLA 基础模型现状

Survey of Vision-Language-Action foundation models for robot manipulation.

- **Existing notes to link:** π0 (Black2024), π0.5 (Black2025), MEM (Torne2026), RoboClaw (Li2026)
- **Additional papers to survey:** RT-2, Octo, OpenVLA, and other representative VLA works
- **Focus:** Architecture patterns (VLM backbone + action decoder), training paradigms (co-training, flow matching), action spaces, generalization strategies

### Section 2: VLN 基础模型现状

Survey of Vision-and-Language Navigation models, especially those leveraging foundation models.

- **Key papers to survey:** NaVILA, NavGPT, VLN-DUET, VLN-CE, ETPNav, and LLM/VLM-based navigation agents
- **Focus:** How VLN is shifting from task-specific architectures to VLM-based approaches; action space differences vs. VLA (discrete waypoints vs. continuous control); sim-to-real gap

### Section 3: 语义 SLAM 与空间表示

Survey of semantic SLAM and spatial representations that can interface with foundation models.

- **Key papers to survey:** ConceptGraphs, SplaTAM, CLIP-Fields, VLMaps, OpenScene, and related 3D scene understanding works
- **Focus:** Scene representations that are both geometrically accurate (for navigation/manipulation) and semantically rich (queryable by VLMs); how SLAM can serve as shared spatial memory for both VLN and VLA

### Section 4: 架构趋同分析

Cross-cutting analysis comparing VLN and VLA architectures.

- **Comparison dimensions:**
  - VLM backbone (PaliGemma, CLIP, SigLIP, etc.)
  - Action space (discrete waypoints vs. continuous joint control vs. hybrid)
  - Scene/memory representation (history tokens, video encoding, 3D maps)
  - Training data (simulation vs. real, scale, diversity)
  - Task horizon (single-step vs. long-horizon)
- **Comparison table schema:** Rows = papers/models, Columns = VLM backbone | Action space | Scene/memory representation | Training data source | Training paradigm | Task horizon | Sim vs. Real
- **Cross-cutting concern:** Simulation environments (Matterport3D, Habitat, AI2-THOR) and the sim-to-real gap as it affects both VLN and VLA
- **Key question:** What are the fundamental architectural similarities and differences? Where is unification natural vs. forced?

### Section 5: 现有 Nav+Manip 系统

Survey of existing systems that combine navigation and manipulation.

- **Key papers to survey:** OK-Robot, SayCan, HomeRobot Challenge, Mobile ALOHA, TidyBot, and similar integrated systems
- **Focus:** How these systems connect navigation and manipulation modules; what are the integration bottlenecks; are they modular pipelines or end-to-end?

### Section 6: Gap 分析与潜在方向

Synthesized from Sections 1-5.

- Identified research gaps
- Potential research directions
- Benchmarks and evaluation considerations (ALFRED, TEACh, HomeRobot Challenge)
- Open questions
- Seeds for the eventual Idea note

## Paper Notes Strategy

### When to create an independent Paper note:

- Representative work in its sub-field (e.g., NaVILA for VLN, ConceptGraphs for semantic SLAM)
- Directly relevant to the unification thesis
- Requires detailed architecture analysis

### When to only mention in Topic note:

- Earlier/background works cited for context
- Papers with similar methods where only conclusions differ

### Estimated new Paper notes: 10-15

- VLN foundation models: ~3-4 papers
- VLA additions (RT-2, Octo, OpenVLA): ~2-3 papers
- Semantic SLAM / spatial representation: ~2-3 papers
- Nav+Manip systems: ~2-3 papers
- VLA models with navigation capabilities (e.g., mobile base control): ~1-2 papers if found

### Existing Paper notes to integrate: 4

- `[[2410-Pi0]]` — π0 VLA foundation model
- `[[2504-Pi05]]` — π0.5 open-world generalization
- `[[2603-MEM]]` — MEM multi-scale memory
- `[[2603-RoboClaw]]` — RoboClaw agentic framework

All Paper notes follow `Templates/Paper.md` format with YAML frontmatter, mermaid mindmap, and wikilinks.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: 文献收集与 Topic Note 搭建

- Search and fetch key papers for each section
- Build Topic note skeleton with one-line summaries and key insights per paper
- Create Paper notes for representative works

### Phase 2: 分析与交叉比较

- Fill in Section 4 (架构趋同分析) with structured comparison
- Build a comparison table across dimensions listed above
- Annotate commonalities and differences between VLN and VLA

### Phase 3: Gap 分析 → Idea 提炼

- Populate Section 6 with research gaps discovered during survey
- When sufficient insight accumulates, extract into an Idea note in `Ideas/`
- Idea note links back to Topic note and relevant Paper notes via wikilinks

## Execution

- **Recommended order:** Section 1 (VLA, leveraging 4 existing notes) → Section 2 (VLN) → Section 3 (SLAM) → Section 5 (Nav+Manip systems) → Section 4 (cross-cutting analysis) → Section 6 (gap analysis)
- Each session focuses on one section at a time
- Claude Code searches papers, generates notes; user reviews and supplements in Obsidian
- Topic note is a living document, updated incrementally

## Conventions

- Language: 中英混用 (Chinese prose, English technical terms)
- Tags: flat English tags (`VLN`, `VLA`, `SLAM`, `embodied-AI`, `navigation`, `manipulation`, `foundation-model`, `indoor-scene`)
- Links: Obsidian `[[wikilinks]]` for all cross-references
- Paper naming: `AuthorYear-ShortTitle.md`
