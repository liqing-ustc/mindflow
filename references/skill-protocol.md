# Skill Protocol

This document defines the SKILL.md format used by MindFlow AI skills. Every skill — whether atomic or orchestrating — must include a SKILL.md at its root. This file serves as the single source of truth for what a skill does, how it behaves, what it requires, and what it produces.

---

## Frontmatter Specification

Each SKILL.md begins with YAML frontmatter enclosed by `---` delimiters. Fields are divided into required and optional.

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string (kebab-case) | Unique identifier for the skill, e.g. `paper-ingest` |
| `description` | string | One-line summary of the skill's purpose |
| `version` | string (semver) | Semantic version, e.g. `1.0.0` |
| `intent` | enum | Primary research activity this skill supports (see values below) |
| `capabilities` | string[] | Functional capabilities this skill uses (see values below) |
| `domain` | enum | Knowledge domain this skill targets (see values below) |
| `roles` | enum[] | Supported interaction modes (see values below) |
| `autonomy` | enum | Default level of autonomous action (`high` / `medium` / `low`) |
| `allowed-tools` | string[] | Claude Code tools this skill may invoke |

**`intent` values:**

- `literature` — reading, summarizing, and connecting research papers
- `ideation` — generating and refining research hypotheses
- `experiment` — designing and running computational experiments
- `analysis` — interpreting results and extracting insights
- `writing` — drafting papers, notes, or structured documents
- `evolution` — self-improvement, protocol updates, and meta-level tasks
- `orchestration` — coordinating other skills into multi-step workflows
- `utility` — file management, formatting, and general-purpose helpers

**`capabilities` values:**

- `search-retrieval` — querying external sources or the local vault
- `research-planning` — constructing and updating research agendas
- `cross-validation` — comparing results across papers or experiments
- `data-processing` — transforming, filtering, or aggregating structured data
- `training-tuning` — running or configuring ML training jobs
- `evaluation-benchmarking` — measuring model or method performance
- `prompt-structured-output` — producing structured output via LLM prompts
- `visualization-reporting` — generating charts, tables, or summary reports
- `agent-workflow` — spawning sub-agents or calling other skills

**`domain` values:** `general` / `cs-ai` / `bioinformatics` / `medical` / `vision` / `nlp` / `data-engineering`

**`roles` values:**

- `autopilot` — skill runs end-to-end without human input
- `copilot` — skill drafts or proposes; human reviews before finalizing
- `sparring` — skill engages in back-and-forth dialogue with the human

**`autonomy` values:**

- `high` — may create files, update memory, and modify agenda without confirmation
- `medium` — may read and draft; must confirm before writing to shared state
- `low` — proposes only; all writes require explicit human approval

**`allowed-tools` values** (Claude Code tool names):

`Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `input` | object[] | Declared inputs; each object has `name` and `description` |
| `output` | object[] | Declared outputs; each object has `file` (glob pattern) and `memory` (memory file to update) |
| `related-skills` | string[] | Other skill names that compose well with this one |

## Body Sections

Every SKILL.md body must include the following sections. Sections are written as Markdown headings (`##` or `###`).

| Section | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `## Purpose` | Yes | What problem this skill solves and why it exists |
| `## Steps` | Yes | Numbered, step-by-step execution instructions for the AI |
| `## Guard` | Yes | Preconditions, invariants, and prohibited actions |
| `## Examples` | Recommended | Concrete input/output examples or usage scenarios |

### Purpose

Explain the skill's goal in 2-5 sentences. Include:
- The research workflow it fits into
- What inputs it consumes
- What outputs or effects it produces

### Steps

A numbered list of executable instructions. Each step should be unambiguous enough for an AI to follow without clarification. Use sub-steps where needed. Reference other skills using their kebab-case names.

```markdown
## Steps

1. Receive `paper_url` or `paper_title` from the user.
2. If `paper_url` is provided, fetch the page with WebFetch.
3. Extract title, authors, abstract, and publication date.
4. Look up any existing note in `Papers/` using Glob to avoid duplicates.
5. Populate the `Templates/Paper.md` template with extracted metadata.
6. Save the completed note to `Papers/YYMM-ShortTitle.md`.
7. Append a provisional insight entry to `Workbench/memory/insights.md` if a novel claim is found.
```

### Guard

A bulleted list of rules the skill must never violate. These act as hard constraints during execution.

```markdown
## Guard

- Never overwrite an existing paper note without explicit user confirmation.
- Never modify `agenda.md` Mission section.
- Do not mark an insight as `validated` without ≥2 independent evidence sources.
- If `autonomy: low`, produce a draft only — do not write any files.
- Always check `Resources/Tag-Taxonomy.md` before assigning tags.
```

### Examples

Optional but strongly recommended. Show representative invocations and expected outputs. Use fenced code blocks or Markdown tables.

## Complex Skills: The `references/` Subdirectory Pattern

When a skill's SKILL.md exceeds approximately 200 lines, or when it requires supporting reference material (schemas, lookup tables, extended examples), split the content using a `references/` subdirectory inside the skill directory.

**Structure:**

```
skills/
  paper-ingest/
    SKILL.md              # Frontmatter + concise Steps + Guard
    references/
      field-mapping.md    # Detailed mapping of paper fields to frontmatter keys
      venue-list.md       # Canonical venue abbreviations
      example-note.md     # Full worked example of an output note
```

**Rules for the `references/` pattern:**

- SKILL.md remains the authoritative entry point. It must be self-contained enough to execute; `references/` files are supplementary detail.
- Reference files are linked from SKILL.md using relative Markdown links, e.g. `[field mapping](references/field-mapping.md)`.
- Reference files do not have their own frontmatter — they are plain Markdown.
- The `references/` directory may not contain nested skill directories (no sub-skills here; use orchestration instead).

---

## Skill Levels

Skills are organized into three levels based on scope and composition.

### Level 0 — Atomic

A single-purpose skill that calls Claude Code tools directly. It does not invoke other skills.

- Typically < 150 lines
- `capabilities` list has 1-2 entries
- `intent` is a leaf activity (not `orchestration`)
- Example: `paper-ingest`, `tag-assign`, `insight-extract`

### Level 1 — Orchestration

A skill that sequences or conditions other skills to accomplish a compound goal. It calls Level 0 skills by name.

- `intent: orchestration`
- `capabilities` includes `agent-workflow`
- Steps reference other skills explicitly: "Run `paper-ingest` for each URL."
- Example: `literature-sweep`, `weekly-digest`, `experiment-pipeline`

### Level 2 — Global

A skill that operates across the entire vault or research state. It may invoke multiple Level 1 skills, modify `agenda.md`, update memory files, or trigger cross-cutting evolution.

- Typically run on a schedule or by explicit human command
- High privilege: `autonomy: high` and broad `allowed-tools`
- Must have an especially strict `## Guard` section
- Example: `memory-distill`, `agenda-sync`, `vault-health-check`

## Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Skill directory name | kebab-case | `paper-ingest/` |
| Category directory name | numbered prefix + kebab-case | `01-literature/` |
| Skill entrypoint filename | Always uppercase | `SKILL.md` |
| `name` field in frontmatter | Must match directory name exactly | `paper-ingest` |
| `related-skills` entries | kebab-case, no path prefix | `["insight-extract", "tag-assign"]` |

**Rationale for numbered category prefixes:** Obsidian and most file explorers sort directories alphabetically. Numbered prefixes (`01-`, `02-`, ...) enforce a logical reading order that mirrors the research workflow (literature → ideation → experiment → analysis → writing → evolution).

**Example directory layout:**

```
skills/
  01-literature/
    paper-ingest/
      SKILL.md
    literature-review/
      SKILL.md
      references/
        review-template.md
  02-ideation/
    hypothesis-gen/
      SKILL.md
  06-evolution/
    memory-distill/
      SKILL.md
    agenda-sync/
      SKILL.md
```
